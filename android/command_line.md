#Workflow
##Introduction
The development steps encompass four development phases:

- **Setup**

Install and setup the development environment (Download SDk)

Create Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) and connect hardware devices.

[Managing Virtual Devices](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html)

[Using hardware devices](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html)

- **Development**

Setup and Develop an android project

[Create an Android project](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html)

- **Debugging and Testing**

Build the project into a debuggable `.apk`package that can be installed abd run on the emulator or a real device.

Using command line tool, the project can be built by using `ant` and install it on a device using [adb](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html)

[Build and run an application](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/index.html)

For debugging an application, use JDWP-compliant debugger [debugging application](http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/index.html)

[testing an application](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/index.html)

- **Publishing **

[Publishing overview](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/publishing_overview.html)

##Essential command line tools

[android](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/android.html) create and update Android projects and create, move, and delete AVDs.

[Android Emulator](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html) Run an Android applications on an emulated Android platform.

[Android Debug Bridge](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) Interface with the emulator or connected device (install apps, shell the device, issuse command...)

Additional tools

`Ant` Compile and build an Android project into an installable `.apk`file

`Keytool` To generate a keystore and private key, used to sign an `.apk` file. Keytool is part of the JDK

`Jarsigner` sign an `.apk` file with a private key generated by keytool
